This is small best practices suggestion about how to organize your IT doc when you 
are IT support engineer on site (dispatched or not at customer place) 


### Table of Contents
 - [Why? /me/that/oh gosh...] (### Why)
 - [What you need to know](### What you need)
 - [How to install it](### How to install )
 - [How to update your doc](### How to use the script)
  - [Ignore Whitespace](#ignore-whitespace)

*Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [French](README.fr.md), [日本語](README.ja.md).*

### Why
Sometimes, you are having hard time finding IT information (about process for exemple)
and you want to make your life easier. Let's say it is at customer place and 
you cannot create / host a wiki for mutiple reasons (confidentiality, no host server locally, etc...)

### How to install

 2 .use the windows batch 
```bash
c:\> blabla 
```
