## IT (Information Technology) Documents Organizer 
This is unpretentious small best practices suggestion about how to organize your IT doc when you 
are IT support engineer on site (dispatched from your company at customer place) and you have 
mostly only a shared folder at disposition.  


### Table of Contents
 - [Why?/me/that/oh gosh...](### Why ?! ?!)
 - [How it looks like](### How it looks like ?)
 - [How to install it](### How to install )
 - [What to do now](### What to do now )
 
*Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [French](README.fr.md), [日本語](README.ja.md).*

### Why ?! ?!
It is quite often that as local on-site IT you might face the following issue:
-the only one place you have to handle doc is a share drive
-you can't use/implement another tool such as a wiki, intranet or a Sharepoint. 
-you are having hard time finding IT information (about process for exemple) and waste your time.
-every time someone else need to cover your activity, the knowledge transfer is a nightmare.
-you want to make your life easier. Let's say it is at customer place and 

So due to contrains I collected few idea here and there to define some easy practices.
Following tthos simple rules, my life became a bit easier.


### How it looks like ?



### How to install 

 1 .Just download the files and folder arborescence to make your own copy.


### What to do now  
Simple:
 1 .Each time you receive a doc, copy it into the proper folder.
 2 .When you have spare time, take the model and write down a process.
 3 .Remember that Windows has step recorder tool that could make 
 your life a bit easier for taking screenshots.
 4 .Periodically verify that your doc is up-to-date.


### Things I need to do still..
- [ ] Correct the bug into the batch file to automatise the folder creation step.


If you are local IT engineer on site and you have some best practices to share,
don't hesitate to comment.
