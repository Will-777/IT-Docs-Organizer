This is unpretentious small best practices suggestion  about how to organize your IT doc when you 
are IT support engineer on site (dispatched from your company at customer place).  


### Table of Contents
 - [Why?/me/that/oh gosh...](### Why ?! ?!)

 - [How to install it](### How to install )
 - [What to do now](### How to install )
 
*Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [French](README.fr.md), [日本語](README.ja.md).*

### Why ?! ?!
It is quite often that as local on-site IT you might face the following issue:
-the only one place you have to handle doc is a share drive
-you can't use/implement another tool such as a wiki, intranet or a Sharepoint. 
-you are having hard time finding IT information (about process for exemple) and waste your time.
-every time someone else need to cover your activity, the knowledge transfer is a nightmare.
-you want to make your life easier. Let's say it is at customer place and 

So due to contrains I collected few idea here and there to define some easy practices.
Following tthos simple rules, my life became a bit easier.
